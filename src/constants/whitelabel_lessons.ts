Following the true ethos of decentralization, they stepped back and let the DAO take shape. While their media company, Bankless LLC, continues to operate as its own media node, the Bankless brand is further propagated through the DAO and its sub-DAOs. Today, the Bankless ecosystem creates user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies through education, media, and culture.</p></div><div class="bloc2"><img src=\'/BanklessDAO/images/banklessdao-constitution/the-genesis-62a4642c.png\'></div>'
